# M-M-S-K Queue Simulation
### This program simulates an M/M/s/K Queue in Python

------------

### Customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate λ.
### The service times of customers are exponentially distributed with parameter 1µ.
### 𝜆 = 2/ℎ𝑟, 𝜇 = 1.5/ℎ𝑟, K = 8
### s = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

### The average number of customers in the system is
